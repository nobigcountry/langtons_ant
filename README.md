#Langton's Ant Simulation
[Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) is a cellular automaton and a two-dimensional Turing machine. This project is a simple implementation of Langton's Ant using the SDL2 library.

By default, the program creates a 1600x900 window for the simulation, with each cell of the grid having a size of 4x4 pixels. These parameters, along with the colors for each cell state, can be easily modified in the `constants.h` header file.

##Compilation and Running the Program
To compile simply run:
   ```bash
   make
